          <h2> Root cause #1</h2>
          <p>Most healthcare insurance companies do not cover enough of the medical cost of receiving care, which causes many low-income and underserved communities, and those without insurance to avoid seeking the preventative and critical care that they require.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p>Evidence 1 = “In many lower-income families, however, parents are covered by employer-sponsored insurance and children are covered by Medicaid or CHIP. For example, parents and children all carry Medicaid coverage in only 46 percent of families with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Insurers, whether public or private, are not required to pay for services provided to household members who are not themselves covered by a policy. Thus, differences in insurance coverage within a family diminish the incentives for any payer to invest in two-generation health programs that serve both covered and non-covered family members.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p>Explanation 1 = Low-income families have been disproportionately affected by inadequate insurance coverage within families because these differences in coverage create more financial barriers to accessing healthcare services for those family members who are not covered. This is because the data shows that even insurance companies like Medicaid, a government program, do not address the healthcare needs of all individuals within low-income families out of the 138% of families under the federal poverty level. Insurance companies make it so that healthcare providers have less incentives to invest in programs that serve both covered and non-covered family members, revealing the business side of healthcare that affects disadvantaged communities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p>Evidence 2 = “But the income eligibility standards for Medicaid and CHIP are different for children and adults. And employee contributions for employer-sponsored health insurance are also substantially higher for workers who cover their families than for those who cover only themselves. For these reasons, even when parents and children all have health insurance, the coverage may come from different sources. In most higher-income families, parents and children are all covered by private, employer-sponsored insurance.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p>Explanation 2 = The different terms and conditions for each insurance plan for each member in the family creates challenges in accessing healthcare services because the cost of care is a large burden for the family for those who are not covered. Those with private insurance plans have the privilege to receive care, but many must deal with the consequences of their health conditions and have their right to care taken away because they can not afford insurance. This shows the unfair and broken system in how income determines the fate of each individual's health.

          <h2>Root cause #2</h2>
           <p>Healthcare professional’s lack of knowledge about different cultures and customs create barriers for giving whole-person care because patients do not feel seen, understood or recognized due to having little health education and will turn to other methods of treatment that they understand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p> Evidence 1 = “However, in the light of the whole person care approach, an attending physician should help the patient eﬀectively reconcile and integrate the spiritual needs and values personally important for him with “the technical dialogue”, especially while making decision on treatment options. All in all, clinicians should not allow medical aspects to suppress a human being within a patient, nor within themselves.” </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
        <p>Explanation 1 = The relationship between the healthcare provider and patient is important because the patient will feel more comfortable receiving care by someone who respects their values and understands their diversity in culture. This shows that receiving competent care works to break down the barriers in healthcare and bridge the gap between culture and medicine. Healthcare becomes more humane when we truly center patients and take in different perspectives of their health rather than what is superficially presented to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4 p-2">
          <p>Evidence 2 = “In the United States, a country of the most technologically advanced and oriented healthcare systems, priding itself with an almost unlimited respect for the patient’s freedom of choice, this kind of approach has prompted a steady rise in the use of intensive care units within the patient’s last 30 days of life (“to survive at all costs”), along with booming health care expenditure at the end of life.It is rather dubious, however, whether this is the right way to alleviate the suﬀering in the majority of patients, boost their sense of personal growth, help them attain essential objectives at the end of life, while oﬀering them comprehensive sup-port and compassion.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col border border-white rounded me-4">
          <p>Explanation 2 = Healthcare in the United States has become so focused on using technology to treat patients that they have forgotten the human side of care. Their attitude towards treatment has increased the number of patients in the ICU because they only treat these conditions as taught traditionally and do not try to alleviate this pain while considering their personal values and wills with compassion.</p>

      <h2>Implications for effective “solutions” for both causes</h2>
      <p>1. Improving and expanding the two-generational programs that already exist to be beyond the focus of infants and mother’s and rather everyone to prevent more health conditions that affect one generation to the other. Transforming these two-generation programs to be more inclusive aim to resolve generational socio-economic problems that affect the parents’ and childrens’ health can save money that is rather spent on separate plans. </p>
      <p>2. Effective solutions are to include cultural education as part of the curriculum for each healthcare career and to make it each hospital's goal in developing their mission to provide whole person care. As the ideal competent care is provided to patients across the world, the health of most individuals would improve, and they will feel more connected in their journey of healing. </p>
