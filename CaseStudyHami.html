          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Centering Healthcare Institute aims to improve health, trans­form care and dis­rupt inequitable sys­tems that affect the social determinants of health through the implementation of the Cen­ter­ing group model in most healthcare institutions. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>This means that they are trying to support healthcare professionals in developing a better understanding and knowledge of how different communities struggle to receive care. It also shows them that healthcare is more than providing care, but rather about treating the root problem, socioeconomic and environmental factors, that affects their health. Not only will this provide higher quality care, but also patients will feel more connected to their journey in developing their health and the community's health</p>

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Most Effective Method</h2>
          <p>The idea of centering empow­ers patients, strength­ens patient-provider rela­tion­ships, and builds com­mu­ni­ties by providing one-on-one health assessments, interactive learning, and by community building, which improves health through quality patient care.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>This means they have an outlined plan to work with healthcare institutions to eliminate health disparities that limit whole person care. Their model  has transformed healthcare delivery and proven how comfortable and valued their patients feel. Their tactics to attempt at resolving these issues have integrated communities and provided underserved communities to be heard and in control of their health outcomes. </p>

          <h2>Use of Technology</h2>
          <p>Communication methods, such as creating a CHI app could be used for these group sessions and ways to post more information. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>This is an effective way to learn more about their health and how they are affected by systemic racism in healthcare to improve health understanding outside of the program. Also, it helps them to stay connected and initiate these meetings to be aware of how they can contribute their experiences to transform healthcare for everyone.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Implications</h2>
          <p>The best way to resolve these health inequalities are adopting this centering model, its communication method to create a way to give reviews on how different hospitals treat and care for patients, rating how well they value patient care.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>In my project I hope to create an app or website that allows you to review how you were treated, how comfortable you felt, how much you learned about your health, and ways they worked to give support in your social determinants of health in hospitals. It will be like a community hospital group chat that can help give these patients a voice to healthcare professionals and the hospital board  as a way to bring more resources and improve patient care. This will strengthen the relationship of local </p>
